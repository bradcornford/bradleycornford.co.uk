                <p><b>Plusnet, Sheffield, 2013 – Current</b><br/><u>(Senior Software Engineer)</u></p>

                <p>Working within one of the internal development teams maintaining and developing existing call centre
                    systems, company external website and sales platforms. My development work has focused on
                    maintaining systems with PHP, PHPUnit, MySQL and using Git for version control. I also maintain
                    Plusnet’s internal PHP coding standards closely following PSR standards, and am a member of their
                    peer review guidance committee. As I take more supervisory responsibility for development projects
                    I regularly assume a project planning role utilising the Scrum / Agile project management framework.
                    My most notable achievement is winning an 'Outstanding Achievement' award for resolving our
                    company’s website usability issues with content blockers with little to no guidance.</p>

                <p><b>SwitchstanceIT, Sheffield, 2011 – 2013</b><br/><u>Creative Web Developer</u></p>

                <p>I was a member of the company’s web development team and had responsibility for server and client
                    side system developments. These developments comprised a combination of internal case study related
                    proof of concept and client commissioned web based systems. During my final fifteen months I
                    utilised and refined the Time and Project management, business analysis and software development
                    methodologies I was taught at University. As a direct result of honing this skill set I was
                    appointed to the lead development role on one of the company’s vertical market products used by the
                    NHS and Universities to publish research project Key Performance Indicators (KPI).</p>

                <p><b>Urban Feather, Scunthorpe, 2009 – 2010</b><br/><u>Web Developer (undergraduate placement year)</u></p>

                <p>I joined this local company for my degree placement year. One of the company's recently identified
                    strategic objectives was to extend its established brochure web site business to provide more
                    functional e-Commerce and CMS managed internet sites. This was a very successful venture and during
                    my tenure the company secured a number of new clients from a diverse range of business sector,
                    ranging from a large Garden Centre chain to a local wool trading company.</p>

                <p><b>Grimsby Telegraph, Grimsby, 2008 – 2009</b><br/><u>Web Designer</u></p>

                <p>I secured this fixed term contract position with the newspapers community portal called
                    ThisisGrimsby. My primary responsibilities were to create and publish news based web pages, Adobe
                    Flash banners and adverts for local businesses. Interestingly enough my limited involvement with
                    this portal provided a valuable insight into the power of social networking as the underlying
                    technology used to support collaborative innovation both within the newspaper business and the
                    wider community.</p>

                </span>

                <p><b>Personal Profile</b></p>

                <p>I am conscientious, self-motivated and analytical with a natural bent for problem solving.
                    I am considered to be an effective communicator with a positive attitude that gets the job done
                    while maintaining my attention to detail. I have strong hands on Microsoft and Open Source web
                    development skills, project planning and customer service experience.</p>

                <p><b>Skills</b></p>

                <p>With the employer's support I have taught myself a number of development languages such as: HTML,
                    CSS, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, jQuery, ActionScript, Bash and Python. I also possess expert knowledge
                    of development tools such as PHP Storm, Git, Git Flow, Jenkins, Confluence, JIRA, FishEye, Composer,
                    PHPSpec and PHPUnit. Finally I have advanced knowledge of Microsoft Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint,
                    Visio, and good knowledge of the remaining Microsoft’s Office suite.</p>

                <p><b>Adaptability</b></p>

                <p>I relish the prospect of change, not change for changes sake, but as a method of continually
                    improving systems and services. I have always adapted to my environment, whether at university, in
                    employment or on the sports field. Although I seldom analyse my adaptability I am convinced it is
                    the result of continually assessing where I am and what is needed to achieve my next goal.</p>

                <p><b>Effective Communications</b></p>

                <p>During a summer placement I had the opportunity to attend a couple of a company’s Corporate Strategy
                    Group meetings as a silent observer. This provided an insight into the manner by which ideas were
                    pitched and sold to Company Directors. This left me with a clear understanding of how important
                    communication skills are. The best idea in the world doesn’t sell itself, it has to be sold and
                    competent selling requires a thorough knowledge of the subject being presented and the ability to
                    communicate in the language used by the audience. I regularly put this experience to good use when
                    presenting ideas within the workplace. I have learnt that truly great communication skills are born
                    of confidence and experience and I’m keen to practice and develop both.</p>

                <p><b>Hobbies & Interest</b></p>

                <p>I was once described as a rugby playing geek and to be fair that’s a reasonable description. I enjoy
                    playing rugby and was a member of the country champion college Rugby sevens team in 2005. I have
                    also been county Judo champion twice in my later teens. My Judo career stalled spectacularly in 2006
                    when I broke my thumb playing rugby at a national level and this injury required surgery. Recovering
                    from this bad luck took nearly a year by which time my Judo contemporaries had moved on leaving me
                    with little or no chance of ever making the grade again. I still enjoy participating in just about
                    any sporting activity and actively attend the gym on a daily basis.</p>
